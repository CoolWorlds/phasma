# phasma

Mathematica script is provided for our implementation of phasma. We do not offer support for the code but aim to provide a more user friednly version in the near future!

The phase curve files are named by KIC number and the planet number. The columns are phase, relative to the transit, flux, theoretical error and inter error (see Jansen & Kippin 2017 for details on the errors).
